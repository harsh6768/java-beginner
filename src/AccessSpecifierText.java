/*
*  Java Access Modifiers :
*
*   Java supports 4 categories of accessibility rules
*  1. private
*  2. protected
*  3. public
*  4. default
*
*  Modifiers can be used for class , member variables and member functions
*
*
*  ------------------------------- With Class -------------------------------
*  For outer class , there can be only two possibilities , either class is a public class or just a class
*  which means it is a default type .
*
*  For Inner class any among four access modifiers can be used
*
*  --------------------------- Remember --------------------
*  1. There can be only one public class in a single java file.
*  2. The name of the java file must be the same as the name of the public class.
*  3. Only public class can be accessed directly from outside the package
*
* ----------------------------- Member variables and functions ------------------------
*
*
* 1. Private :
*     When members of the class are private , they can not acccessed from outside the class body .
*     They are meant to be accessed from the same class in which they are declared .
* 2. Protected :
*    When members are protected , they can be accessed from any class of the same package
*    and child class from the other package.
* 3. Public :
*    When members are public , they are accessible from any class of any package.
* 4. Default :
*    When members are default , they are accessible only from the class of same package.
