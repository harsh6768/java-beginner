/*
*  1. Packages are nothing more than the way we organize files into different directories according to their
*    functionality , usability as well as category they should belong to
*  2. Files in one directory ( or package ) would have different functionality from those of another directory
*
*  Example :
*  For Example : files in java.io package do something related to I/O , but files in java.net package give us the way to
*               deal with the Network
*
*
*   Name collision : Packaging also helps us to avoid class name collision when we use the same class name as that of others
*
*   The benefits of using packages reflect the ease of maintenance , organization , and increase collaboration
*   among developers
